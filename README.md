This mod simply triggers an autosave when the `Quit Game` button is pressed, _while in game_.

**However**, please keep the following information in mind.

* Double check that the game saves by looking in the top-left corner for the saving icon. If this does not appear, save manually.
* Wait until the game finishes saving before you click the confirmation button that appears after hitting `Quit Game`.
  * If you click the confirmation button early, it will tell you that it is currently saving, but when it finishes saving, the game will not close. Repeating this process can eat up your autosave slots with duplicate saves.
